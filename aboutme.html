    <p>Hi folks, I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer by profession and co-author of the book Sculpting Data for ML. I am passionate about identifying novel and practical problems and have tackled many interesting ones over the years like filtering spoilers, sarcasm detection, curbing fake news/misinformation/abuse/spam, clothing size recommendation, improving conversational experience, and so on. Currently, I combine my past engineering experiences in designing low-latency massive-scale systems and research experiences in Applied Machine Learning to develop distributed Machine Learning solutions for conversational commerce at Attentive.</p>
		
    <p>I have <a href="https://rishabhmisra.github.io/publications/" target="_blank">published and refereed</a> publications at some of the top conferences in Machine Learning (like RecSys, ACL, WSDM, ICML, KDD, etc.) and have a blooming <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nURar74AAAAJ" target="_blank">citation record</a> (400+). There has been a wide adoption of datasets I curated as part of my research. Some notable instances include Deeplearning.ai's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow</a> course using them for teaching purposes, an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1949110" target="_blank">NSF project</a> using them for designing activities to engage high school students in building text classifications models, researchers using them for <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.543.pdf" target="_blank">tracking epidemiological news articles</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jamell-Dacon/publication/352109548_Does_Gender_Matter_in_the_News_Detecting_and_Examining_Gender_Bias_in_News_Articles/links/615c80715a481543a8874fbe/Does-Gender-Matter-in-the-News-Detecting-and-Examining-Gender-Bias-in-News-Articles.pdf" target="_blank">studying gender bias in news</a>, <a href="https://www.brazilianjournals.com/index.php/BRJD/article/view/29714" target="_blank">building sarcasm dataset in Portuguese</a>, <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.semeval-1.137.pdf" target="_blank">studying humor detection</a>, and so on.</p> 
  
    <p>These days, I am engaged in spreading awareness around data-centric views and approaches in AI, which is also one of the topics in our book Sculpting Data for ML, through conference talks. Please follow DataForML handle on <a href="https://twitter.com/DataForML" target="_blank">Twitter</a>

    <p>In my downtime, I enjoy watching sci-fi shows, exercising, gaming, and spending time with my family. I presently live in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
