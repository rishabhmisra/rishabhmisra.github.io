    <p>Hi folks, I am a Machine Learning Engineer & Researcher and co-author of the book "Sculpting Data for ML." I have experience in designing low-latency, massive-scale ML pipelines from scratch and have extensively published and reviewed papers at top ML conferences in NLP, Deep Learning, and Applied ML domains. I frequently consult on real-world applications of these technologies. My background has trained me to identify impactful problems, design effective solutions, and deploy them in production. Currently, I leverage my engineering and research experiences to develop distributed ML solutions for conversational commerce at Attentive.</p>
		
    <p>As a researcher, I am passionate about tackling novel and practical problems such as filtering spoilers, detecting sarcasm, curbing fake news/misinformation/abuse/spam, recommending clothing sizes, and enhancing recommendations in conversational experiences. I have <a href="https://rishabhmisra.github.io/publications/" target="_blank">published and refereed</a> papers at top Machine Learning conferences like RecSys, ACL, WSDM, ICML, and KDD and have a growing citation record with over <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nURar74AAAAJ" target="_blank">600 citations</a>. The datasets I curated as part of my research have been widely adopted. Notably, they are used in Deeplearning.ai's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow</a> course, an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1949110" target="_blank">NSF project</a> for engaging high school students in building text classification models, and by researchers for <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.543.pdf" target="_blank">tracking epidemiological news articles</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jamell-Dacon/publication/352109548_Does_Gender_Matter_in_the_News_Detecting_and_Examining_Gender_Bias_in_News_Articles/links/615c80715a481543a8874fbe/Does-Gender-Matter-in-the-News-Detecting-and-Examining-Gender-Bias-in-News-Articles.pdf" target="_blank">studying gender bias in news</a>, <a href="https://www.brazilianjournals.com/index.php/BRJD/article/view/29714" target="_blank">building sarcasm dataset in Portuguese</a>, <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.semeval-1.137.pdf" target="_blank">studying humor detection</a>, and so on.</p> 

    <p> As an engineer, I focus on designing innovative Machine Learning solutions at a real-world scale. I have developed deep learning models from the ground up, trained on hundreds of millions of data points in a distributed manner, and deployed them in production systems handling over 10 million queries per second (QPS). My experience spans the entire Machine Learning stack, including problem formulation, data analysis and opportunity sizing, data and feature engineering, model development, deployment and scaling, as well as model experimentation and monitoring.</p>
    
    <p>In general, I stay engaged in raising awareness around data-centric views and approaches in AI, which is also one of the topics in our book Sculpting Data for ML, through conference talks. Please follow DataForML handle on <a href="https://twitter.com/DataForML" target="_blank">Twitter</a>

    <p>In my downtime, I enjoy watching sci-fi shows, exercising, gaming, and spending time with my family. I presently live in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
