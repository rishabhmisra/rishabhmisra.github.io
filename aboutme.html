    <p>Author of the book "Sculpting Data for ML", I am a Lead ML Engineer & Researcher recognized by the US Government for outstanding contribution to ML research. I have extensively published and reviewed research at top AI conferences in NLP (LLMs / GenAI), Deep Learning, and Applied ML domains, such as ICML, KDD, ACL, TheWebConf, and RecSys, amassing over <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nURar74AAAAJ" target="_blank">700 citations</a>. I specialize in designing low-latency, large-scale Deep Learning models and my work has received wide media coverage, notably by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/spoiler-warning-this-neural-network-spots-dangerous-reviews-before-you-read-them/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/this-artifical-intelligence-tool-will-spot-spoilers-for-you/articleshow/70144063.cms" target="_blank">Times of India</a>, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tech/8549579/ai-bots-doomsday-scenario-world-takeover/" target="_blank">The Sun</a>, <a href="https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/this-ai-system-warns-you-about-spoilers-in-online-reviews-story-GLoiQ7MN6JewqXZaXwxMeI.html" target="_blank">Hindustan Times</a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-new-study-reminds-us-how-ridiculous-spoiler-culture-h-1837171945" target="_blank">Gizmodo</a>, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/SpoilerNet-UCSD-AI-Catch-Spoilers-Researchers-Studying-What-Makes-Text-Spoilery-513510001.html" target="_blank">NBC</a>, and <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/568383/spoiler-tool-spoilernet/" target="_blank">Slash Film.</a> My research work is also being used in Deeplearning.ai's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow</a> course, used as training material for Google's TensorFlow professional certification program, and used in an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1949110" target="_blank">NSF project</a>, Narrative Modeling with StoryQ, to teach the concept of text classification models to high school students. The Data Science community has utilized my research artifacts hundreds of thousands of times to learn and apply ML concepts on leading platforms like Kaggle. Professionally, I am an ML Tech Lead of a foundational team driving 0 to 1 AIâ€‘powered personalization efforts for Conversational Commerce (marketing relevant products through text/email) at a late-stage startup and have previously led AI-powered user personalization at Twitter and Amazon.</p>
		
    <p>As a researcher, I am passionate about tackling novel and practical problems such as filtering spoilers, detecting sarcasm, curbing fake news/misinformation/abuse/spam, recommending clothing sizes, and enhancing recommendations in conversational experiences. As an engineer, I focus on designing innovative Deep Learning based solutions at a real-world scale. I have developed deep learning models from the ground up, trained on hundreds of millions of data points in a distributed manner, and deployed them in production systems handling over 10 million queries per second (QPS). My experience spans the entire Machine Learning stack, including problem formulation, data analysis and opportunity sizing, data and feature engineering, model development, deployment, scaling, experimentation, and monitoring. </p>
	    
<!-- 	    The datasets I curated as part of my research have been widely adopted. Notably, they are used in Deeplearning.ai's  course, an  for engaging high school students in building text classification models, and by researchers for <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.543.pdf" target="_blank">tracking epidemiological news articles</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jamell-Dacon/publication/352109548_Does_Gender_Matter_in_the_News_Detecting_and_Examining_Gender_Bias_in_News_Articles/links/615c80715a481543a8874fbe/Does-Gender-Matter-in-the-News-Detecting-and-Examining-Gender-Bias-in-News-Articles.pdf" target="_blank">studying gender bias in news</a>, <a href="https://www.brazilianjournals.com/index.php/BRJD/article/view/29714" target="_blank">building sarcasm dataset in Portuguese</a>, <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.semeval-1.137.pdf" target="_blank">studying humor detection</a>, and so on.</p>

    <p>In my downtime, I enjoy watching sci-fi shows, exercising, gaming, and spending time with my family. I presently live in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
